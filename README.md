Hi Reader!

I just practised some basic JavaScript commands to create the good ol' rock-paper-scissors game! For now, it's only JavaScript and is accessible only through the console, but I hope to convert this to a GUI-based game as soon as I learn how to do it.

It was super fun making it, and I strongly encourage you to do this if you're a JS noobie like I am!
