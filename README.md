Hi Reader!

Here it is! My first actually-functional webpage! 
This is a rock-paper-scissors game made using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. 
While I had practiced how to use buttons in JS before, this was the first time I applied it to a situation. That was a little challenging, but super fun!
This project helped me gain a wee bit more confidence with JavaScript, and if you want to conquer your fear, go ahead and give it a shot!
Because I used Mozilla to test the website, it isn't quite compatible with Chrome yet. I'm yet to learn how to do that.
